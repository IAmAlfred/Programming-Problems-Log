Took me a while but once you figure out the purpose of nested if..else statements, programming becomes much simpler.
The purpose of nested ifelse statements is to narrow down the choices.
i.e.

int user = 21;

if (user <= 18) {
	System.out.println("User is 18 or younger");
} else if (user > 18 && user < 40) {
	System.out.println("User is between 19 and 39");
}
else {
	System.out.println("User is older than 40");
}
